The CSS property `calc()` is not working as expected when used with multiple units. For example, the following code should center an element but might not depending on the browser or other factors:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  width: calc(100vw - 20px); /* 20px margin on each side */
  height: calc(100vh - 40px); /* 20px margin top and bottom */
}
```

The issue is that the `calc()` function is evaluated in a specific order, and sometimes unexpected results can occur when different units (e.g., `vw` and `px`) are mixed.

Another subtle issue arises when using `calc()` with percentages and other units.
Consider this example:
```css
.element {
  width: calc(50% - 20px);
}
```

In this case, `50%` might not calculate as `50%` of the parent container before subtracting 20px. This can happen if the parent element is not yet rendered and therefore its width isn't known.
